##### music visualizer #####
##
## Note: In order to make music visualizer work you'll
## need to use mpd fifo output, whose format parameter
## has to be set to 44100:16:1. Example configuration:
## (it has to be put into mpd.conf)
## This is the simplest way to configure it. ncmpcpp has to
## be compiled with support for it.
visualizer_fifo_path = "/tmp/mpd.fifo"

## Note: To enable spectrum frequency visualization
## you need to compile ncmpcpp with fftw3 support.

##### song format #####

## Note: Below variables are for alternative version of user's interface.
## Their syntax supports all tags and colors listed above plus some extra
## markers used for text attributes. They are followed by character '$'.
## After that you can put:

alternative_header_first_line_format = "$b$8$aqqu$/a {%t}|{%f} $atqq$/a$9$/b"
#
alternative_header_second_line_format = "{{$5$b%a$/b}{ - $b%b}{ (%y)}}|{%D$9}"

## Note: Below variables also supports
## text attributes listed above.
